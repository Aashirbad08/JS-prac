// DataTypes of JavaScript Summary:-
/* Primitive Types - 7 Categories
These primitive datatypes are generally of Call By Values.
The 7 categories are - String,Number,Boolean,null,undefined,symbol,BigInt

SYMBOL - To make a value unique the user uses the symbol datatype. Specially in advanced JS 
development user sometimes want to make a button unique then this datatype is used.
BigInt - Used when the numerical value is too large.

This iz what called as Primitive Datatype. 
*/
/*Non Primitive Datatype or Reference Type:-
Array,Object,Function
*/

/*Difference between Call By Value and Call By Reference
In call by value method of parameter passing, the values of actual parameters are copied 
to the functionâ€™s formal parameters.
There are two copies of parameters stored in different memory locations.
One is the original copy and the other is the function copy.
Any changes made inside functions are not reflected in the actual parameters of the caller.

WHERE AS

In call by reference method of parameter passing, the address of the actual parameters is
passed to the function as the formal parameters. In C, we use pointers to achieve call-by-reference.
Both the actual and formal parameters refer to the same locations.
Any changes made inside the function are actually reflected in the actual parameters of the caller.

// JAvaScript as a Dynamically Typed Language
/*
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means that variable types are determined at runtime,
and you do not need to explicitly declare the type of a variable before using it. You can assign different
types of values to a variable during its lifetime.

For example, in JavaScript, you can do the following:
let x = 10; // x is now a number
x = "Hello"; // x is now a string
x = true; // x is now a boolean

On the other hand, statically typed languages require you to declare the variable's type explicitly, and the
type checking is done at compile-time, before the code is executed.
Languages like Java, C++, and TypeScript are statically typed, and they require you to specify the variable
type explicitly when declaring them:

int x = 10; // x is a variable of type int
String name = "John"; // name is a variable of type String
JavaScript's dynamic typing allows for more flexibility but can lead to potential runtime errors if not handled carefully.
Static typing, on the other hand, provides better type safety at the cost of some initial verbosity and strictness.

const score = 100; //number
const scorevalue = 100.3; //number
const isloggedin = false; //boolean
const outsideTemp = null; //null which means it is completely empty
let userEmail; //undefined
let userEmail1 = undefined; //undefined

// TO pass Symbol datatype:-
const id = Symbol("123");
const anotherid = Symbol("123")
/*
In this case you might be thinking that these 2 values are same but these 2 values are different bcz of sybol datatype
This is the only work of the symbol to make things  different as if you pass the same value then also the resultng
output is different.
Lets Check
*/
console.log(id === anotherid); //false
// As you can see the resulting output is different.

// Array
const heros = ["batman","Spiderman","Ironman"]
// the arrays are written within the square brackets as written above.

//Object
let myobj ={
    name : "aashirbad",
    age : "22",
}
/* Inside the curly braces all the contents are values and the datatype can be of anything i.e. String,Number,Boolean,null,
undefined,symbol,BigInt,Array,Function or it can be another object too.*/

//Syntaxof declaring a function
/*
function(){}; ----- defination of a function
functions can be declared with many types but as of now we will declare it using variables.*/
const myfunction = function(){
    console.log("hello world");
}
// Now to know what type of datatype a value or a variable is
//We will use typeof operator to identify it
console.log(typeof myobj); //object

// But by the theory of ECMA Script what value the typeof operator will give :-
/*
Primitive Datatypes:-The predefined data types provided by JavaScript language are known as primitive data types. Primitive data 
types are also known as in-built data types.
Non-Primitve Datatyes:- The data types that are derived from primitive data types of the JavaScript language are known as non-primitive 
data types. It is also known as derived data types or reference data types.
Return type of variables in JavaScript
1) Primitive Datatypes:- 7 types
       Number => number
       String  => string
       Boolean  => boolean
       null  => object
       undefined  =>  undefined
       Symbol  =>  symbol
       BigInt  =>  bigint

2) Non-primitive Datatypes:- 3 types
       Arrays  =>  object
       Function  =>  function
       Object  =>  object
All the primitive datatype are returned as functions and the functions type is generally known as object function.*/

// ---------------------------------------------------------MEMORY------------------------------------------------------

/*
Memories are of 2 types --- Stack and Heap Memory
Stack Memory is generally used where Primitive Datatypes are used. &
Heap Memory is generally used where Non-Primitive Datatypes are used.

Whenever the Stack Memory is used then you get a copy of the variables you have declared, So any changes made ot will directly
reflect in the copy you get, not in the original values.
Whenever the heap memory is used then you will get the reference this means the changes will be reflecting in the original value content.
*/
// Examples of Stack Memory:-
let myname = "lipun";
let anothername = myname;
anothername = "aashirbad"
console.log(myname); //lipun
console.log(anothername); //aashirbad
/*
As you have declared 2 variables that s myname and anothername it is reflected in the memory but as you said the value of anothername
will be myname then the copy of myname will be reflected in the memory and all the changes will be reflected in the copy not in the
original content.
So the myname value remains constant and it gives the original data and the anothername shows the changed value.
*/

// Lets Check with another example
let user1 = {
    email : "user@gmail.com",
    upi : "user@ybl",
}
let user2 = user1
user2.email = "aashirbad@yahoo.com" //it means the email need to be changed 
console.log(user1.email);
console.log(user2.email);
/*
here you can see that both the values of user1 as well as user2 has been changed that is here the value of user2 will get the reference
of user1 and the cahnges which are done in the user2 will directly change the original content as it is a Heap memory as here it is a
Non-Primitive datatype (OR) Reference Datatype.
BUT in case of Stack Memory we were getting a copy of the original memory so here the original content is not getting changed the changes
are only reflected in the copy content.
